# Coding Samples

I uploaded a few coding samples here. (Last update: May 22 2024)

## Julia Solving Consumption-Saving Problem with Uncertainty

(IN PROGRESS)

I am going to solve a consumption-savings problem with

* A tight borrowing constraint: the household is not allowed to borrow at all
* Unemployment

This work is originally an assignment of ECON202A UCB taught by Jon Steinsson in 2023 Fall. My original version is written in Matlab (Uploaded already), I am going to rewrite it in Julia here.

## Code for a Project on Industrial Organization

(FINISHED)

This is a collaborative project with Shan Huang, focusing on Laplace New Energy Technology Co., Ltd. and examining the dynamics of China's photovoltaic cell industry. I am responsible for all the figures and code here. The outcome of the research is a 15,000-word report in Chinese, which can be found on my personal website.
